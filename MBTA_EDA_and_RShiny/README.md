# MBTA - EDA Report and R Shiny

This was the final project for MA615(Data Science in R) in the Fall of 2022. The project contained EDA report checking the reliability of Boston's MBTA(Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) transit with MBTA data. You can get the data from the site https://www.mbta.com/developers. Also, I made the map app using Google API key through the Shiny app. The app demonstrates how to show multiple routes of bus and subway instead of single route. The shiny app's code is in the folder "mbta_app".

You can read the project report from "mbta_EDA.pdf". Shiny App link: https://ol0sjn-jiun-lee.shinyapps.io/mbta_app/

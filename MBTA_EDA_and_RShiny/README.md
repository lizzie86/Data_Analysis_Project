# MBTA Transit Reliability and Route Display App

## Overview
This project was developed as the final project for the MA615 (Data Science in R) course in the Fall of 2022. It includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report on the reliability of Boston's MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) transit system and a Shiny application that displays multiple bus and subway routes.

## Shiny Application
The Shiny app integrates the Google Maps API to demonstrate the display of multiple transit routes, enhancing the user experience by providing comprehensive route options rather than a single route. This application is useful for users looking to explore various transit options within the Boston area.

## Repository Structure
- `mbta_app/`: Contains the complete source code for the Shiny application.
- 'mbta_EDA.pdf': Contains the EDA report of the MBTA's reliability.
